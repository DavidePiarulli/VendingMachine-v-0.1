# Vending Machine v-0.1

This is a small project I did on my first week of learning JAVA. 
It is a simple back-end only vending machine that takes user input through a scanner class, takes the coins the user has given to make the purchase of the item selected and gives back to the user the change amount if needed.

## ðŸš€ About Me
 I have been actively learning JAVA, SQL(with a focus on PostgreSQL atm) and SPRING after a back-end bootcamp. My goal for the moment is to score a job in the web development industry and to continue learning to become a true expert.
